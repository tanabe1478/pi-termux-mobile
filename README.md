Minimal Android app that embeds Termux-built binaries (Node.js 26.4.0, bash,
coreutils, git, ripgrep, fd, openssh, npm, util-linux `script`, …) plus a
**pi-durable** harness (`@earendil-works/pi-durable` 1.0.2 + pi-ai/chord, with
pi-coding-agent 1.0.2 bundled for the CLI + TUI) behind a tiny
HTTP/SSE/WebSocket bridge (`runtime/server.mjs`). UI is a local WebView on
`http://127.0.0.1:<port>` (ephemeral port → `files/home/.pi-mobile/port`,
token → `…/token`).

The durable harness gives: SQLite-backed conversations
(`files/home/.pi-mobile/harness.sqlite` — survive process death,
`harness.resume()` continues interrupted runs), a `subagent` tool (child
conversations owned by the calling task), model selection per conversation,
and per-conversation execution environments — including remote hosts.

## Android device awareness

On Android, `PiService` writes an atomic status snapshot every five seconds using
native Android APIs. The read-only `android_device_info` tool reports model,
Android version, battery percent/charging/power saver, and active network
transport/internet validation. Snapshots older than 30 seconds are rejected.
The system prompt explains the Android sandbox and directs the agent to use the
tool rather than claiming all device information is inaccessible.

The app requests `ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE` (normal permission). It does not collect
SSID/IP addresses, location, account information or unique hardware identifiers.
This tool does not change settings, capture the screen or access other apps'
private files. A future self-improvement workflow needs scoped user-approved
changes and rollback; native app updates still require rebuilding/installing an APK.

## GitHub authentication

Use **Menu → GitHub** to register a fine-grained PAT. Choose only the repositories
you intend to develop, with Contents read/write for clone and push (read-only
for clone). Workflow changes or organization policies may require additional
permissions/approval. The app validates the token against GitHub's `/user` API;
this does not guarantee access to every repository or operation.

The credential is stored in the app-private `~/.pi/agent/github.json` with mode
0600, never in localStorage, remote URLs or git config. Local coding tools and
the Pi CLI use a GitHub-only executable `GIT_ASKPASS` script. No token is copied
from the Mac. Use normal HTTPS GitHub URLs; SSH authentication remains separate.
Logout deletes the local credential; revoke it on GitHub to invalidate it.
The token is not encrypted by this implementation and trusted shell/code inside
the app sandbox can read private app files. Grant minimal repository permissions.

## App pages

- **Chat** (`/`) — durable pi conversation (prompt, abort, new session,
  model dropdown), plus **ChatGPTでログイン**. Tap it, open the browser link,
  sign in with ChatGPT, then return to the app. The model list refreshes and
  an OpenAI model is selected automatically. A full callback URL can be pasted
  as a fallback. Login can be cancelled and times out after five minutes;
  tokens stay in the private `auth.json`, never in browser storage.
  The login bar is hidden when an OpenAI OAuth credential is stored; reconnect
  via **Menu → ChatGPT認証**. Expired access tokens are refreshed by pi-ai.
  `pi mobile` header links back here from every page.
- **GitHub** (`github.html`) — validate/register a scoped PAT, show the connected
  account, and delete the saved credential.
- **API keys** (`keys.html`) — provider key management (list/add/delete,
  stored as `~/.pi/agent/auth.json` in pi CLI format).
- **Sessions** (`sessions.html`) — local durable-session browser: create a
  session, reopen an earlier one, or remove it from the visible list.
- **Clients** (`clients.html`) — remote SSH host registry + device keypair
  (ed25519): generate, show pubkey, interactive `ssh-copy-id` in the
  terminal page.
- **Remote** (`remote.html`) — attach to durable sessions on other machines
  via the pi-server protocol: choose a saved SSH host, select/create/remove a
  session, and choose that remote session's model (see below).
- **pi CLI** (`terminal.html`) — real pi TUI over WebSocket → `script` PTY
  → `node cli.js`, with on-screen extra keys (esc/tab/ctrl/arrows/pgup/pgdn)
  for menus and scrollback. `?ssh=user@host` runs `ssh -tt <host> pi`
  instead — full remote pi TUI.

## Remote control, two ways

### 1. SSH pi TUI (immediate, full fidelity)

`ssh`/`ssh-copy-id`/`ssh-keygen` ship in the rootfs. Workflow:
Clients → *generate key* → *add client* (`user@host[:port]`) → `⇧key`
(interactive ssh-copy-id, type remote password) → `▸_` connects. The menu
item *pi CLI (ssh)* does a one-off connect without saving a host.

### 2. pi-server protocol (multi-client attach to durable sessions)

`runtime/pi-serverd.mjs` is a `pi-server` (`createUnixServer`) host app:
durable Harness + own SQLite under `~/.pi-serverd/`, services
`sessions.list/create/delete/attach/models` and
`chat.prompt/abort/state/configure/history/events` (events via long-poll
cursor — Chord subscriptions deliberately skipped).

```bash
# on the remote machine (Node >= 22, same runtime dir, uses ~/.pi/agent/auth.json)
node pi-serverd.mjs        # socket: ~/.pi-serverd/server.sock
```

The phone bridge (`runtime/remote-client.mjs`) forwards the remote unix
socket through the saved SSH client entry (`ssh -N -L port:~/.pi-serverd/server.sock`
— OpenSSH 6.7+ unix→tcp forwarding; SSH is the auth, no extra token), then
attaches via `@earendil-works/pi-client` with a small TCP
`ByteTransportFactory`. `user@host:port` is converted to OpenSSH's `-p port`
form. The Remote page connects and loads sessions as soon as a host is
selected, creates one automatically when the host has none, opens the newest
session first, restores its transcript, and displays a model picker using the
remote host's available models. Remote uses non-interactive SSH key login, so
run **⇧key** / `ssh-copy-id` for a host before using it here.
Endpoints: `/api/remote/{connect,sessions,models,model,create,delete,attach,prompt,abort,state,history,events,disconnect}`.

Deleting a session removes its entry from `~/.pi-serverd/sessions.json`, so it
no longer appears or can be attached through Remote. Its SQLite data is kept
as a safety measure; it is not a destructive database purge. `pi-client` runs
on the phone as the protocol client, while the durable harness, model calls,
and tools run in `pi-serverd` on the remote host. For the full interactive Pi
TUI instead, use **Clients → ▸_** or **pi CLI (ssh)**; run it in `tmux` when an
SSH disconnect must not end the TUI process.

### 3. env-server (remote *tool execution*, different thing)

A conversation whose cwd is `remote:<name>:/path` runs its tools on that
host via `runtime/remote-env.mjs` (client) + `runtime/env-server.mjs`:

```bash
# on the remote machine — Node >= 22, no deps
PI_REMOTE_TOKEN=<secret> PI_REMOTE_PORT=7842 node env-server.mjs

# on the phone (env of the node process / PiService)
PI_REMOTES='{"workstation":{"url":"http://host:7842","token":"<secret>"}}'
```

Use Tailscale/WireGuard instead of plain LAN HTTP where possible — the env
server executes arbitrary commands.

## Layout

- `android/` — Gradle project (app module, Java only, no NDK)
- `runtime/` — `server.mjs` (durable bridge + `/pty` WS + remote attach),
  `pi-serverd.mjs` (remote session daemon), `remote-client.mjs` (pi-client
  + ssh tunnel), `remote-env.mjs`/`env-server.mjs` (tool exec),
  `public/` (chat, keys, clients, remote, terminal pages + shared menu),
  package.json for prod node_modules
- `debs/` — Termux apt packages (aarch64) + extracted `rootfs/` used to build
  `rootfs.bin` (see below)
- `tools/` — local toolchain (JDK 21, Android SDK, Gradle 8.10.2) — not committed

## Download a CI-built APK

On this fork, open **Actions → Build APK**, select a successful run, and
download the **pi-termux-mobile-debug-aarch64** artifact. Unzip it and install
`app-debug.apk` on an ARM64 Android phone (allow installs from that source).
You can start a build with **Run workflow**; pushes to `master` also build.
Artifacts expire after 14 days. These are debug builds, not production releases.

CI creates both omitted runtime assets: Node dependencies are installed from
`runtime/package-lock.json` without lifecycle scripts, and aarch64 Termux
packages plus their dependencies are downloaded from the official repository,
checked against its SHA-256 index, and extracted without maintainer scripts.
The artifact includes a package version/checksum manifest. Termux packages track
the current repository, so later builds may bundle newer binaries. Device
startup and Android background behavior still need testing on a real phone.

## Build

Before the first build, generate the runtime assets (macOS/Linux; `dpkg`
required for the Termux packages):

```bash
python3 scripts/package-rootfs.py
(cd runtime && npm ci --omit=dev --omit=optional --ignore-scripts)
node --test runtime/test/*.test.mjs
python3 scripts/package-runtime.py
```

After changing runtime code, rerun `package-runtime.py` and increment
`RUNTIME_VERSION` in `RuntimeInstaller.java` so installed apps extract the update.

```bash
cd android
JAVA_HOME=<path-to>/tools/jdk21 ./gradlew assembleDebug
# APK: app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk (~107 MB, aarch64 only content)
```

Toolchain notes:

- JDK 21 (Temurin) — Gradle/AGP 8.7.3 does not support the system JDK 25.
- compileSdk 35, minSdk 26, targetSdk **28** — keeps direct `execve()` of
  app-private binaries working (Android 10+ SELinux blocks it for
  targetSdk >= 29). `PiService` falls back to launching node via
  `/system/bin/linker64` if direct exec ever fails, so targetSdk can be raised.
- `RUNTIME_VERSION` in `RuntimeInstaller.java` gates re-extraction — bump it
  whenever assets change.

## Repackaging assets

```bash
# rootfs.bin = gzipped tar of the Termux usr/ tree
cd debs/rootfs/data/data/com.termux/files
tar czf ../../../../../android/app/src/main/assets/rootfs.bin usr

# runtime.bin = gzipped tar of the pi runtime as runtime/ prefix
# IMPORTANT: strip node_modules/.bin dirs + dangling symlinks first —
# toybox tar on-device exits non-zero on them and extraction aborts
cd runtime
find node_modules -type d -name .bin -exec rm -rf {} +    # npm recreates these!
find node_modules -type l ! -exec test -e {} \; -delete
tar czf ../android/app/src/main/assets/runtime.bin --transform 's,^,runtime/,' \
  server.mjs remote-env.mjs env-server.mjs pi-serverd.mjs remote-client.mjs \
  package.json package-lock.json public node_modules
```

(.bin suffix because aapt decompresses *.gz assets into the APK uncompressed.
`RuntimeInstaller` tolerates tar's non-zero exit when the expected payload
files are present — bad-symlink warnings are only logged.)

## Install / run

```bash
adb install android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
# or wireless: ./install-wifi.sh (pairs via mDNS, installs, starts)
```

First launch extracts ~170 MB to app-private storage, then a foreground
service starts `node runtime/server.mjs`. Open the app → API keys page to
store a provider key, then prompt. Local conversation state lives in
`files/home/.pi-mobile/harness.sqlite` and survives process death. The
**Sessions** page lists local sessions, opens an earlier session, creates a
new one, or removes a session from the visible list; the session registry is
stored in `files/home/.pi-mobile/sessions.json`.

Caveats on device:

- MIUI kills the process aggressively in the background (foreground works
  fine): Settings → Apps → pi mobile → battery saver "no restrictions" +
  autostart.
- Android 12+: phantom-process killer may kill node/bash subprocesses;
  workaround needs `adb shell settings put global
  settings_enable_monitor_phantom_procs false` or the Android 14+ developer
  option. Foreground service + PARTIAL_WAKE_LOCK are held while running.
- Termux scripts inside the bundle have `com.termux` shebangs and will fail;
  binaries are invoked directly by absolute path (npm CLI shim may need
  `node $PREFIX/lib/node_modules/npm/bin/npm-cli.js` instead of `npm`).
- `stty -F /dev/pts/N` is used to push terminal resizes into the `script`
  PTY (control frames are `\x01`-prefixed JSON on the WS).
